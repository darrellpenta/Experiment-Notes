1. SEMREL
-------


============== 6/3 MEETING
--Look at relationships not scaled and centered??
--SEMREL 1 drop association
--CAT rel * Int 
--PROP ALL THREE (all in random effects) 3 way in both
-- Prop full with Just int, just rel
--Tease apart all three 
---ALL THREE 
No association (REL AND INTEGRATION)




-emp log weighted....
ME of Int 
--both as continuous and dichotmous factors
ME of Rel
--Nuisance factors are regressed out??
********DP 
5/25 see regression notes docs
********NP
-5/19 - Get all data, including singular

--What to do about residuals (notes taken)
--Add mFULL model with all items in error (int*ass*rel) (not working, higher order interactions possibly working)
--look at interactions!! (appears to work)
--random effects structure (Barr et al. )
--drop char length?? (Adressed)
--analyses with and without association
--slopes for nuisance factors  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/130714/random-and-fixed-effects-structure-in-linear-mixed-models
--Association!!! has been fixed
--individual correlations

--Check CAT COR data
--all three models together (skip resids for overall)


=========
Mixed effect logit regressions???






2. DISCO
-------
-Transcribed up to 12
-R script to turn the MEL output file into an excel spreadsheet
-R script for creating the F1 and F2 data files
-R script for running factorial analyses
Goal: Finish transcribing up to 50 and run analyses
---
* ONLY Critical sentences transcribed-- NP
* Subject running & transcription-- (Let this guy know)
* Summer subjects running

=========================================================================

3. REPRIME
-------
-R script for F1 and F2 analyses for SemRel and SemRel 2 items
Goal: Norming of unrelated items;
* Transcriptions ( match Mel)?
* Are lists balanaced? -NP
* Finish analyses; 
* 104 is last one transcribed
group number has list number
Foxpro skips any line that doesn't start with grop num, sub num, or any num
trial column, item_subexp_headtype_lntye, Vtime, 
* list item file (tab delim file)

Relatedness 
Association
UNRH--CAT,NONCAT LN
UNRH--
2 lists for Semrel, to lists for Cat, 3 for semrel
6 lists, 72 items pre-list
36 people

=========================================================================


==========================================================================


-R script for regressions is basically ready
Goal: Finish analyses
-Prosody for SemRel 2?
