-For Items, we need all the association versions
	Transformations: 
	ASIN vs. LOGIT (no log10)
	AssHL
          
SR No association (Int * Rel) [Max RE]--DONE
SR No association (Ass * Int)-- DONE

CAT -rel (and/or rel * int) good - DONE

SR2 No integration [Max RE] --DONE

for ALL  (use the Bates model) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Interpreting model convergence BIC, AIC
--What would be a criterion for convergence
--Remove higher order terms 


+DO ANALYSES ON NORMING DATA -DONE
+MAYBE TO THE SEMREL ANALYSES

===========================




============== 6/12 MEETING


============== 6/3 MEETING
--Look at relationships not scaled and centered?? Done; not discussed with Neal yet
--SEMREL 1 drop association. Done 
--CAT rel * Int. Done
--PROP ALL THREE (all in random effects) 3 way in both. Done
--emp log weighted.... Discussed but nothing done
	--ME of Int 
	--both as continuous and dichotmous factors
	--ME of Rel
--Nuisance factors are regressed out? Discussed. Not done

********NP
-5/19 - Get all data, including singular

--What to do about residuals (notes taken)
--Add mFULL model with all items in error (int*ass*rel) (not working, higher order interactions possibly working)
--look at interactions!! (appears to work)
--random effects structure (Barr et al. )
--drop char length?? (Adressed)
--analyses with and without association
--slopes for nuisance factors  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/130714/random-and-fixed-effects-structure-in-linear-mixed-models
--Association!!! has been fixed
--individual correlations

--Check CAT COR data
--all three models together (skip resids for overall)
 





==========================================================================


-R script for regressions is basically ready
Goal: Finish analyses
-Prosody for SemRel 2?

Psychonomics
Dissertation proposal
