1. SEMREL
-------


============== 6/3 MEETING
--Look at relationships not scaled and centered??
--SEMREL 1 drop association
--CAT rel * Int 
--PROP ALL THREE (all in random effects) 3 way in both
-- Prop full with Just int, just rel
--Tease apart all three 
---ALL THREE 
No association (REL AND INTEGRATION)




-emp log weighted....
ME of Int 
--both as continuous and dichotmous factors
ME of Rel
--Nuisance factors are regressed out??
********DP 
5/25 see regression notes docs
********NP
-5/19 - Get all data, including singular

--What to do about residuals (notes taken)
--Add mFULL model with all items in error (int*ass*rel) (not working, higher order interactions possibly working)
--look at interactions!! (appears to work)
--random effects structure (Barr et al. )
--drop char length?? (Adressed)
--analyses with and without association
--slopes for nuisance factors  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/130714/random-and-fixed-effects-structure-in-linear-mixed-models
--Association!!! has been fixed
--individual correlations

--Check CAT COR data
--all three models together (skip resids for overall)


=========
Mixed effect logit regressions???








==========================================================================


-R script for regressions is basically ready
Goal: Finish analyses
-Prosody for SemRel 2?

Psychonomics
Dissertation proposal
